# PLANETWATCHERS - TRANSFORMING CITIZENS INTO SCIENTISTS THROUGH GAMIFICATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATA COLLECTION WITH GLOBE OBSERVER.

## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY

The Hippogryph team developed the PlanetWatchers project, an interactive platform that promotes citizen science through an educational game. Participants begin in a learning environment, where they prepare to become citizen scientists. Then, they head out to the field to collect environmental data using NASA's Globe Observer, which allows them to record information on clouds, vegetation, mosquito habitats, and changes in Earth's surface. These observations, which can be gathered by any citizen, enhance the quality of available data and significantly contribute to the advancement of global science, enabling a better understanding of environmental phenomena. During missions, data collection earns points that recognize players' progress, turning them into true agents of change. The project encourages attentive observation and environmental awareness. PlanetWatchers aims to increase people's interaction with the environment, promoting sustainable practices and teaching about ecosystem preservation, biodiversity care, and natural phenomenon monitoring as a way to protect the balance between living beings and their habitats. Through this game, participants are empowered to play an active role in building a better and more sustainableÂ future.
